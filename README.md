## FAQ

#### Is it safe to login to your app as currently the url at http://159.223.91.154/ says that it is not secure?

Yes definitely! All authentication is handled by Google's Firebase & we do not store any information!

#### When will the url be replaced with letters ( with a proper domain name )?

Currently we are planning to change the URL to a domain name called "mystudyspace" where the domain name will reflect our actual product name around July!

#### Why I can't login with Facebook?

Facebook has informed all developers that they require all websites to have SSL/ Https. Currently we are only using http as SSL is not configured

#### Will I be able to use this app after Orbital ends?

Yes! We are planning to share this app with NUS students in the future! If things go well, we will share the app with students from other schools too!
